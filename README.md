# Elevate

Given a starting and ending location, the Elevate program will allow the user to find a path between the two which either minimizes or maximizes elevation gain during the trip. When maximizing, user enters a  time desired for the trip, and then the program determines the path of most change in elevation that covers that distance or time.
