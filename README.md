# Elevate

Given a starting and ending location, the Elevate program will allow the user to choose a difficulty level for the path between two points. The assumption is they will be running, walking or biking, so are choosing the level of resistance. The algorithm will then create the path based on their choice. What determines difficulty is a combination of the length (distance) of the path, as well as the amount of elevation gain (hills).


## Getting Started

Clone the following repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/CS520-Elevate/Elevate
```

### Prerequisites
Python Programming Language

```
Folium
